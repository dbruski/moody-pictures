# Moody pictures

This react app was made to search for nice pictures using unsplash api and save them in one place so you can look at them whenever you want.

## To build this app i used: 
- React and React Hooks
- React Router Dom
- Styled Components
- Axios
- Material icons
- To avoid having backend I saved state in localstorage
